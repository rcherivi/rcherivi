## My Projects 🔥 
| Project Name        | Summary           | Tools I Used  |
| --------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [The Re-implementation of the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT) Algorithm and Time Complexity on Simulated Haplotypes](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/jda242/PBWT_Reimplementation) | Evaluated the performance of the Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform (PBWT) algorithm in efficiently identifying long shared segments among large sets of haplotypes. We re-implemented the PBWT algorithm in Python, adapting its core components, including the construction of the positional prefix array, tracking of match start positions, PBWT matrix reconstruction, reverse reconstruction for validation, and set-maximal match queries to analyze genetic data. We also simulated 1000 diploid samples (2000 haplotypes) of African descent with realistic Out of Africa models for chromosome 21 to test our algorithm with. | The re-implementation was done with **Python**.
| [Predicting Wine Quality: A Comparative Approach](https://github.com/rcherivi/stsci3740final) | Analyzes the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to identify key factors influencing wine quality and build predictive models. We used both regression and classification approaches to model the quality score (0–10) based on physicochemical features such as acidity, sugar content, sulfates, and wine type (red or white). Starting with a baseline linear regression model, we explored alternatives including Lasso Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Generalized Additive Models, Logistic Regression, and QDA/LDA. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE, AIC, Accuracy, and ROC/AUC. | Machine Learning Models, Feature Engineering/Selection with Dummy Variables and AIC, Hypothesis Testing, Train/test split with **R**.
| [Real or Fake: A Machine Learning Approach for Political News Classification](https://github.com/mekam790/ai4allc6g3)       | A machine learning pipeline to detect AI-generated political news articles, addressing concerns about misinformation and its impact on public trust. Processed 16,000+ articles from the GoodNews dataset using Regex, lemmatization, and feature filtering. Trained high-performing models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest) achieving accuracy scores above 89%, and deployed a logistic regression model in a Streamlit app for real-time predictions. | Machine Learning models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest), Data Cleaning, train-test split using  **Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn**.
| [Rite Agent](https://github.com/rcherivi/riteAgent)      | Automates SQL query and generates reports based on the Oracle Fusion Projects Data by using a RAG-based and Langchain agents. Creates a downloadable Excel file of the report generated with its SQL Query. | LLMs, ChatOpenAPI, SQL Query Generation, Parsing Data, Vector Embeddings using Pinecone Vector Database, Streamlit with **Python**  |
| [AIRY](https://github.com/yzhao2433/seeds-airy)     | A mental health-focused app designed to help college students manage stress and improve well-being by providing a supportive community for sharing thoughts and emotions. By offering a safe space for anonymous journaling and motivational messaging, Airy aims to reduce social isolation and foster a sense of belonging. | TypeScript, JavaScript, React-Native, Design Thinking, UI/UX   |
| [Garden Simulation Game](https://github.com/rcherivi/CS3110FinalProject)     | An interactive terminal garden game where the user can cultivate their own colorful collection of plants. The user can feed and water their plants and watch their leafy friends grow. However, nature is full of surprises, and the user will need to watch out for mysterious pests and sudden natural disasters that seek to destroy all their hard work.  The user can use their plants to bake delicious foods, and they can sell their produce to make money and upgrade their garden to new sights never seen before. The user will need to stay vigilant to preserve their garden and make it to the end of the game! Just download the game and run **dune exec ./bin/main.exe** in the terminal to play! | Used functional and object-oriented programming in **OCaml**.  |
| [Big Data Cup Analysis](https://github.com/yzhao2433/big_red_cup24)      | There are three types of penalties that can occur in a hockey game: a minor (two minutes), a double-minor (four minutes), and a major penalty (five minutes). Whenever a penalty occurs in ice hockey,  the team that takes the penalty becomes the penalty killer while the opposing team becomes the power play. **In this project, we attempted to analyze the impact of special teams and whether the amount of Power Plays for a team increases a team's success in scoring a goal in Women's Hockey using data from Statletes BDC**.     |   Feature Engineering/Selection with Dummy Variables and AIC, Hypothesis Testing, Train/test split, Residuals, Multicollinearity, Multi-Linear Regression Model, RMSE, and Predictive Modeling Function with **SQL, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn, SciPy, Statsmodels**  |
| [Tertiary Education Analysis in OECD countries](https://github.com/rcherivi/OECD-Tertiary-Education-Analysis/tree/main) |  Observed the percentage of people in OECD countries who obtained a tertiary degree. **Of the factors like GDP, average income, number of private and public universities, etc. that can impact the percentage of the population with tertiary education in a country per year, which factors have more impact on the percentage of the population with tertiary education in OECD countries?**  |  Feature Engineering/Selection with Dummy Variables and AIC, Hypothesis Testing, Train/test set, Residuals, Multicollinearity, Multi-Linear Regression Model, MSE, RMSE, OLS regression testing, and Predictive Modeling Function with **SQL, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, Missingno** |
