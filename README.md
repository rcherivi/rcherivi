## My Projects üî• 
| Project Name        | Summary           | Tools I Used  |
| --------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [AIRY](https://github.com/yzhao2433/seeds-airy)     | A mental health-focused app designed to help college students manage stress and improve well-being by providing a supportive community for sharing thoughts and emotions. By offering a safe space for anonymous journaling and motivational messaging, Airy aims to reduce social isolation and foster a sense of belonging. | TypeScript, JavaScript, React-Native, Design Thinking, UI/UX 
| [Garden Simulation Game](https://github.com/rcherivi/CS3110FinalProject)     | An interactive terminal garden game where the user can cultivate their own colorful collection of plants. The user can feed and water their plants and watch their leafy friends grow. However, nature is full of surprises, and the user will need to watch out for mysterious pests and sudden natural disasters that seek to destroy all their hard work.  The user can use their plants to bake delicious foods, and they can sell their produce to make money and upgrade their garden to new sights never seen before. The user will need to stay vigilant to preserve their garden and make it to the end of the game! Just download the game and run **dune exec ./bin/main.exe** in the terminal to play! | Used functional and object-oriented programming in **OCaml**.  |
| [Big Data Cup Analysis]([https://github.com/rcherivi/bigdatacup2024](https://github.com/yzhao2433/big_red_cup24))      | There are three types of penalties that can occur in a hockey game: a minor (two minutes), a double-minor (four minutes), and a major penalty (five minutes). Whenever a penalty occurs in ice hockey, the player that takes the penalty serves in the penalty box while their team plays shorthanded. Both of these teams play their special teams, a power play or a penalty killer. The team that takes the penalty becomes the penalty killer while the opposing team becomes the power play. A power play team has the advantage and typically plays their strongest offensive players in an attempt to maximize their scoring chances which are increased due to a greater number of players. The penalty killers play their best defensive play in an attempt to prevent the other team from scoring during the penalty. **In this project, we attempted to analyze the impact of special teams and whether the amount of Power Plays for a team increases a team's success in scoring a goal in Women's Hockey using data from Statletes BDC**.     |   Feature Engineering/Selection with Dummy Variables and AIC, Hypothesis Testing, Train/test set, Residuals, Multicollinearity, Multi-Linear Regression Model, RMSE, and Predictive Modeling Function with **SQL, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn, SciPy, Statsmodels**  |
| [Tertiary Education Analysis in OECD countries](https://github.com/rcherivi/OECD-Tertiary-Education-Analysis/tree/main) |  Observed the percentage of people in OECD countries who obtained a tertiary degree. **Of the factors like GDP, average income, number of private and public universities, etc. that can impact the percentage of the population with tertiary education in a country per year, which factors have more impact on the percentage of the population with tertiary education in OECD countries?**  |  Feature Engineering/Selection with Dummy Variables and AIC, Hypothesis Testing, Train/test set, Residuals, Multicollinearity, Multi-Linear Regression Model, MSE, RMSE, OLS regression testing, and Predictive Modeling Function with **SQL, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, Missingno** |
